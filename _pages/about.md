### About me

I am a PhD student at the [Department of Atmospheric and Cryospheric Sciences (ACINN)](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/acinn/), Universität Innsbruck.  
For my PhD, I am working with the Open Global Glacier Model [OGGM](https://oggm.org/) on the topic of "Improving our understanding of future multi-century mountain glacier changes and runoff", supervised by [Fabien Maussion](https://fabienmaussion.info/) and [David Rounce](https://www.cmu.edu/cee/cryotartans/people/david-rounce.html). 

Explore my publications and preprints for a complete list of contributions. A selection is provided below.

### Education & previous research
I hold an [M.Sc. in Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/programmes/ma-atmospheric-sciences) with a focus on Climate and Glaciology from the Universität Innsbruck, Austria. My Master's thesis topic was the [Response time sensitivity of glaciers using the open global glacier model: from idealised experiments to an estimate for alpine glaciers](https://resolver.obvsg.at/urn:nbn:at:at-ubi:1-59629), supervised by [Fabien Maussion](https://fabienmaussion.info/). During my Master's studies, I also worked as a student research assistant on the climatology of precipitation and moisture sources over an arid region in Northeast Greenland as part of the [Northeast Greenland Caves Project](https://northeastgreenlandcavesproject.com/), led by Gina Moseley, which resulted in a [publication (Schuster et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-2-1-2021).  

Previously, I earned a B.Sc. in Physics at the Universität Konstanz, Germany, complemented by an internship at the Andøya Space Center in Norway, where I worked on my Bachelor thesis about simulating height-dependent solar UV irradiance in the mesopause region.
